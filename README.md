## Making GIF Pattern Animations in Python Matplotlib
This code was written by Eleanor Lutz to generate [this website](http://tabletopwhale.com/colorpalette.html). 

I learned Python a few months ago from the [UW Software Carpentry Course](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/) and needed a practice project to work on. This is a script that makes a GIF illustration for any 5-unit color scheme. The script features five different animated patterns, all based on Islamic mosaics.
